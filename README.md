# ProjectD: Autonomous vehicle application concept using simple machine learning technique. 

-Motivation: around 330,000 drowsy driving crashes occur annually. About 6,400 people were killed in such incidents.” 
-Our idea is to use embedded IoT device to identify drivers drowsiness according to drivers’ eye 
position and mouth position. When a driver is identified to be drowsy while driving, alarms will be triggered to warn the driver,           
   
-Techniques used: Machine Learning-Classification 
-Algorithm: CNN (Convolutional neural network)
-Model: pre-trained model “Resnet50” from the Tensorflow library.
